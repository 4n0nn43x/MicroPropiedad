  - [ ] Test initialize()
  - [ ] Test purchase-shares()
  - [ ] Test distribute-payout() + claim-payout()
  - [ ] Test access control
  - [ ] Test edge cases (double-claim, insufficient balance)
- [ ] Write unit tests for property-factory.clar
- [ ] Integration tests (factory + property)
- [ ] Deploy to local devnet
- [ ] Test with Clarinet console

#### 6. Frontend dApp (Next.js) ⏳
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14 project
- [ ] Setup i18n (EN/ES)
- [ ] Setup TailwindCSS
- [ ] Implement wallet connection
  - [ ] Xverse integration
  - [ ] Leather integration
  - [ ] Hiro Wallet integration
- [ ] Build pages:
  - [ ] Landing page
  - [ ] Marketplace (property list)
  - [ ] Property detail page
  - [ ] Investor dashboard
  - [ ] Purchase modal
  - [ ] Claim payout interface

#### 7. Backend API ⏳
- [ ] Setup Node.js/Express API

- [ ] Oracle service (simulate revenue distribution)
- [ ] Property data endpoints
- [ ] Analytics endpoints

#### 8. Deployment & Demo ⏳
- [ ] Deploy contracts to Stacks testnet
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel
- [ ] Deploy backend to Railway/Fly.io

## 🎯 MVP Scope (Hackathon Ready)

### Must Have
- ✅ Property smart contract (tokenization + distribution)
- ✅ Factory registry
- ⏳ Basic frontend (read + purchase + claim)
- ⏳ Wallet connection (at least 1: Xverse)
- ⏳ Demo property on testnet
- ⏳ Simulated payout distribution
- ⏳ Demo video

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Multiple properties in marketplace
- [ ] Property filtering/search
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] Secondary market UI

## 📈 Technical Metrics

### Smart Contracts
- **Lines of Code**: ~700 (property.clar: ~390, factory: ~280, trait: ~50)
- **Functions**: 35+ (public + read-only)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (pending)
- **Security Audits**: 0 (post-hackathon)

### Frontend
- **Status**: Not started
- **Target**: Next.js 14 + TailwindCSS
- **Languages**: EN + ES

### Backend
- **Status**: Not started
- **Target**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL

---

## 💡 Key Innovations

1. **Bitcoin-Backed Real Estate**: First fractional property platform on Stacks/sBTC
2. **Pull Pattern Distribution**: Scalable to thousands of investors
3. **Oracle-Verified Revenue**: Transparent, verifiable rent distributions
4. **LATAM Focus**: Targeting high-growth markets (Brazil, Colombia, Argentina)
5. **SIP-010 Compliant**: Standard token interface for DeFi composability

---

## 🏆 Competitive Advantages

- ✅ Bitcoin security (via Stacks L2)
- ✅ Lower barriers to entry ($10+ vs $10,000+)
- ✅ Automated revenue distribution (no manual processing)
- ✅ Transparent on-chain records
- ✅ Liquid secondary market (future)
- ✅ LATAM-specific compliance understanding

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Research Phase
- sBTC is production-ready with active development
- Pull pattern is essential for scalability
- Clarity v3 uses `stacks-block-height` (not `block-height`)
- Oracle verification is critical for RWA trust

### Development Phase
- Clarity trait system enables modular design
- Event emission is crucial for frontend indexing
- Snapshot mechanism prevents distribution gaming
- Factory pattern in Clarity = Registry pattern

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (MVP)

1. **Centralized Oracle**: Demo uses single oracle (production needs multi-sig)
2. **No KYC**: MVP skips compliance (production requires KYC/AML)
3. **No Legal SPV**: Demo property (production needs real entity)
4. **Testnet Only**: MVP on testnet (mainnet requires audits)
5. **Limited Testing**: Basic tests only (production needs comprehensive suite)

---

- ✅ Architecture
- ⏳ Basic frontend
- ⏳ Demo deployment

### Phase 2: Alpha (Post-Hackathon) - Weeks 3-6
